# Portfolio
### (under construction)
Essentially, this project began as a university assignment. We needed to create a websiteÂ 
that would fit into a real context, like a website for a store, company, portfolio, or whatever else there is.

## How I made it
I've used only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website.
You can check how it looks through this link right here: https://bruno-srio.github.io/portfolio/

## Progress
So far, the site has a very simple layout due to the time I had to do it,
but I do intend to continue developing it over time, adding my projects and experiences that I have acquired.

## Any suggestions or tips would be great and I'll list the ones that I like the most over here:
